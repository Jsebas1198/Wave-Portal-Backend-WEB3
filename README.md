## About the contract

This is an smart contract that store messages or waves that will be shown on the Front-End of the App, so everyone that have access to it, will be able to send and see all the messages that the community send in real time. When the contract is deployed, it is funded with some eth, and when an address calls the weaver function have a chance to get 0.001 eth that will be sent by the contract.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
